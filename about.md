 I try to explore new horizons and new ways of thinking as much as possible. Usually, simplicity and agility to change are the two qualities I like to foster most of my work as the only true immutable is change. My formal education is in Telecommunication engineering and I have a master's degree in digital signal/image processing. I learned to do software by doing and reading a lot: the longest journey starts with a single step.

After all these years, I learned to fight complexity. I try to find the tools to solve my problem: I am not bending the tools I know to solve a problem they are not fit to solve. Yesterday, it was .Net. Today, it is Java, NodeJs and Scala. Tomorrow... I don't have all the answers, but I am looking forward to finding the answer to your problem. 

If I look at my solution 6 months ago, and I think it is perfect: I have a problem. The only immutable principle is the continuous evolution: business needs and technology change everyday.

I am continually reading non-technical books. Sci-fi and fantasy are my favour, but my favour english-writer is [Salman Rushdie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie) and my favour spanish-writer is [Alejo Carpentier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejo_Carpentier); so, I read different genres. Similar to my preference on music and films, I certainly enjoy [Rachmaninov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff), but also enjoy ["Enter Sandman"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CD-E-LDc384) or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMp55KH_3wo).
