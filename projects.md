The followings are the projects I've been working on Github. I tried to put the most recent one up-front, but sometimes I go back and forward from one to another.

- [GCP and dump1090 aircraft data collection and visualization](/gcp-ads-b-collector): Experiments with dump1090/FightAware receiver capturing and visualizing airplane traffic.

- [PX4 SITL ROS Examples](/px4-sitl-ros-example): PX4 SITL with ROS and Gazebo examples.

- [NVIDIA Jetson TX1 OpenCV 101 Tutorials](/nvidia-jetson-opencv-101/): Here you will found the code from the OpenCV 101 tutorials. The tutorials a bit old and there are a couple of things that need to be fixed to be implemented with OpenCV 3.3.1.

- [ROS Ignite Academy : ROS in 5 Days projects](/ros_ignite_academy_ros_in_5_days/): I am playing with ROS Ignite Academy and ROS. This repo contains all the code I wrote there.

- [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree - SageMaker Deployment](/DLND-sagemaker-deployment/): Contains a few tutorials, mini projects and a project using SageMaker for NPL.

- [DJI Service](/dji-service/): DJI Mobile Service SDK on an Android Things application.

## Udacity's Flying Car Nanodegree

- [3D Estimation](/FCND-Term1-P4-3D-Estimation/): Extended Kalman Filter(EKF) implemented with C++. we need to fusion noisy GPS, IMU, and compass(magnetometer) to estimate current drone position, velocity, and yaw.

- [3D Quadrotor Controller](/FCND-Term1-P3-3D-Quadrotor-Controller/): Implement and tune a cascade PID controller(C++) for drone trajectory tracking.

- [3D Motion Planning](/FCND-Term1-P2-3D-Motion-Planning/): Planning and executing a trajectory of a drone in an urban environment.

- [Backyard Flyer](/FCND-Term1-P1-Backyard-Flyer/): Control a simulated drone using python to fly in a square trajectory in a backyard.

## Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree

### Term 3: Path planning, concentrations, and systems

- [Capstone](/CarND-Capstone): Create a set of ROS packages to drive Carla, Udacity's self-driving car. This ran in a real car!

- [Functional Safety](/CarND-Functional-Safety-P3/): Functional safety documentation for a Lane Assistance system under ISO 26262.

- [Semantic Segmentation](/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation-P2/): Semantic segmentation using fully convolutional networks(FCN). 

- [Path Planning](/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P1/): Path planning algorithms to drive a car on a highway using Udacity's simulator.

### Term 2 : Sensor fusion, localization and control

- [Model Predictive Control](/CarND-MPC-Project-P5/):  Model Predictive Control (MPC) implementation to control a car in Udacity's simulator.

- [PID](/CarND-PID-Control-P4/): PID controller to control a car on Udacity's simulator.

- [Kidnapped Vehicle => Particle filter](/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-P3/): Kidnapped Vehicle project. Particle Filter applied to A Kidnapped robot problem. 

- [Unscented Kalman Filter](/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-P2/): Unscented Kalman Filter Implementation with C++.  A simulator generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object, and the Unscented Kalman Filter[UKF] must fusion those measurements to predict the location of the object. 

- [Extended Kalman Filter](/CarND-Extended-Kalman-Filter-P1/): Extended Kalman Filter Implementation with C++. A simulator generates noisy RADAR and LIDAR measurements of the position and velocity of an object, and the Extended Kalman Filter[EKF] must fusion those measurements to predict the location of the object.

### Term 1: Deep learning and computer vision

- [Vehicle Detection](/CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5/): Vehicle Detection using Linear SVM classifier and computer vision.

- [Advanced Lane Lines Finder](/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines-P4/): Advance Lane Line Finder on a Video Stream.

- [Behavioral Cloning](/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3/): Behavioral Cloning. Trying to reproduce my driving behavior in a simulated environment using LeNet and Keras.

- [Traffic Sign Classifier](/CarND-TrafficSignClassifier-P2/): Traffic Sign Classifier. The project consists of training a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize traffic signs. 

- [Lane Lines Finder](/CarND-LaneLines-P1/): Finding Lane Lines on the Road. This project consists of algorithms to identify lane lines on the road on a video. The video is taken from a camera at the center of a vehicle.

## Scala projects

- [Kamon Logstash back-end](/kamon-logstash/): Kamon-stash back-end module. Using ELK(Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana) for data collection and visualization for Kamon.

- [Advent of Code](/advent-of-code): Problem Advent of Code site problems solutions with Scala.

- [Family Playground](/family-playground/): Proof of concept for a REST-full service using Scala/Play, Elasticseach and Couchbase.

- [Airplane Adventures](/airplane-adventures/): Using Scala to process the information of a Dump1090/Flightaware receiver.
