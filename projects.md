The followings are the projects I've been working on Github. I tried to put the most recent one up-front, but sometimes I go back and forward from one to another.

- [NVIDIA Jetson TX1 OpenCV 101 Tutorials](/nvidia-jetson-opencv-101/) : Here you will found the code from the OpenCV 101 tutorials. The tutorials a bit old and there are a couple of things that need to be fixed to be implemented with OpenCV 3.3.1.

- [ROS Ignite Academy : ROS in 5 Days projects](/ros_ignite_academy_ros_in_5_days/) : I am playing with ROS Ignite Academy and ROS. This repo will contain all the code I wrote there.
